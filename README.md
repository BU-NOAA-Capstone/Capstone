# BU-NOAA Capstone Project Summary Report
### 6th May 2021

## Team and Project Introduction 
We are a team of 4 students, Jaya Nagesh, Shuyi Zhu, Shamika Kalwe, and Selma Sentissi El Idrissi from the Master of Science in Business Analytics program at Boston University Questrom School of Business. As part of our program, we are doing a Capstone project with NOAA/NIDIS with the following goals in mind. First, we would like to correlate drought with Agricultural industry (starting from a crop-state pair and expanding from there, e.g. Corn-New York). Then, we would like to predict parameters related to Agriculture with reference to drought (e.g. yield etc.). Following that, we will make a front-end/dashboard to enable dissemination of the above analysis to farmers. Finally, we will constitute a database that stores relevant subset of data from public repositories, with a backend to update/merge routinely or as needed. 

## The significance of the project/motivation behind
The purpose of this project is to increase dissemination of available drought related information to farmers in a way that allows them to develop a multi-seasonal drought mitigation strategy. 
Even though there is vast amount of data about drought monitoring already publicly available, users in the farming industry need a customizable front end to serve the necessary information in an understandable format that could be very useful. In this project, we will build a database to store the necessary portion of the drought-related data, a front end that delivers relevant reports, a backend to update and maintain data, as well as a plugin that performs predictive analysis based on available models, starting with New York State and corn.

## The expected steps to reach the end goal
We are applying the machine learning techniques to build predictive models for corn yield based on the input information of temperature, precipitation, and agricultural-related indices such as USDM, SPI and EDDI. We will focus on building Machine Learning models for this project and get an approximate yield amount for New York corn. We will store the model at the backend so when the most updated data is available, we can operate the model for the long run. 
In terms of the front-end dashboards, we are planning to utilize Tableau dashboards to show the trend of corn yield and drought level in the past. And then, along with our prediction models, the corn yield will also be drawn on the dashboards. 


## Current progress and challenges faced
Currently, we have data for some of the indices, we have done some exploratory data analysis and now we will move on to correlating Temperature, Precipitation and indices like USDM, EDDI, and SPI with USDA data. 	
We encountered a few issues along the way. First the data sources are quite spread out and it took us time to identify the sources. Then, the learning curve for efficiently accessing the data in an automated fashion was time consuming. Finally, we understand that we are new to this domain, thus we had to get speciality help for understanding different concepts.

## Next steps
Related to our future expectations, we strive to make a difference to the agricultural farmers of New York, by providing insights that will be delivered through a user-friendly dashboard in order to aid decision-making. To do so, we plan on expanding our analysis in order to make a bigger impact - to not only include corn, but other crops such as apples, cranberries, etc. We also plan on using machine learning techniques to make predictions on crop yields for the future in light of the drought conditions.
